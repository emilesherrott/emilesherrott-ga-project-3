## [CEST Workspaces](https://emilesherrott-ga-project-3.herokuapp.com/)
### Project Description

Based on a feed of data from the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/), my team member, Ole Nascimento and I set about building a visually interesting and intuitive web app to  utilise a broad range of data available. <br />
I was passionate about this project as weather applications are widley understoodchose and used. Fitting my desire to work on projects which could be of use to a wider range of users as possible.
